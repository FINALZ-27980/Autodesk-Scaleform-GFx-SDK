# This file defines an app based on FxShippingPlayer. The files that normally need to be changed
# will go in a directory named after this file in LocalApps. Each supported mobile platform will
# have its own icons and manifest. The Flash content and other resources are shared.
#
# Run make for the desired platforms once to setup the app.
#
# On Android, build the app by running make after making your changes. 
# On iOS, an Xcode project will be created. Use this project to build and deploy the app; make does not
#         actually build these apps.


# The display name of your app (visible to users)

#  Android main activity will be: com.scaleform.<APP_NAME>.MainActivity

# If the file list is too long for one line, you can put a backslash, followed immediately by a return (newline)

# (See StarforceTD.def for an example of multiple files with directories)
