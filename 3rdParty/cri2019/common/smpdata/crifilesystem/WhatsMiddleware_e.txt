Middleware is software that takes care of audio and video playback for your application.  
Middleware bridges the gap between your application software and the target hardware platform.  It solves sticky audio and video problems on your behalf, allowing you to concentrate on game application development.  
Middleware is a relatively new concept that has been generated by increasingly large-scale, highly developed, and complicated recent software.  
Compare middleware against the term  "OS", or "Operating System."  Although there is no explicit boundary between those two terms, an Operating System is lowest and closest to hardware, but middleware has a much broader range of applications.
