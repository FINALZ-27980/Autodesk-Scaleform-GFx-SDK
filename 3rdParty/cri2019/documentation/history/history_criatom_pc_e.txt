4. Revision history
 [2019-05-17 CRI Atom Ver.2.19.03]------------------------------------------
(1) Bug fixes
  (a) Fixed a bug where audio which was muted using the Category mute function or solo function was played back
      with an amplitude of about -96 dB, which results in audio still being audible depending on the playback device.
  (b) Fixed a bug where Block end transition processing was performed early if the following conditions were met:
      - The number of divisions is specified for the Block.
      - The Block length (in ms) cannot be divided by the number of divisions.
      - The criAtomExPlayer_SetSequencePrepareTime function is used for the playback player.
  (c) Fixed a bug where illegal access may have occurred when accessing Selector Label information
      when using ACF data output according to CRI Atom Craft Ver.3.40.00 to Ver.3.41.03.
  (d) Fixed a bug where the delay (reverberation) was interrupted when using the following effects:
      - delay
      - echo
      - Multi-tap delay

      when multiple AWB handles were used in stop processing and release confirmation processing
      with ACB handle specification.
  (b) Fixed a bug where the error E2017031600 occurred and library ending processing was not completed.
  (c) Fixed a bug in which unauthorized access occurs within the cue playback processing,
      when selector information necessary for cue playback does not exist in the ACF data.
  (d) Fixed a bug where the subsequent action track was not played back
      when a cue using multiple action tracks was playing,
      if the search of the cue designated as the target of the action failed.
  (e) Fixed a bug in which the sound controlled by the voice limit group did not operate
      when the structure of the cue was not a sequence in playback using an ACB outputted
      with CRI Atom Craft Ver.1.
  (f) Fixed a bug where the bussend setting was not applied correctly
      and there was a possibility of silent playback when using ACB outputted
      with the CRI Atom Craft Ver.1.
  (g) Fixed a bug where resume / pause actions for categories were not being applied.
  (h) Fixed a bug where execution of the following functions failed for compressors
      that do not use side chains:
       - criAtomExAsrRack_GetCompressorRms
       - criAtomExAsrRack_GetCompressorRmsByName
  (i) Fixed a bug where the upper limit value of compressor attack time was different

       - 200[ms] -> 3000[ms]
  (j) Fixed a bug where the transition (played) completed block processing was not performed properly
      in block sequence playback using initial playback track during transition,
      and block transition was occurring at unintended timings.
  (k) Fixed a bug where the error E2018090601 occurred in the ACF registration process
      and the work size calculation required for ACF registration failed
      when the following conditions were satisfied:
        - Not using category category cue items
  (l) Fixed a bug where a cue whose playback was canceled
      by the playback probability setting was counted in the played number
      and the category cue limit processing was applied.
  (m) Fixed a bug where the audio after a loop was not being played correctly
      when seeking ADX audio data with an encrypted loop.
       * Please apply the CRI Base Ver.2.45.06 or later version.
  (n) Fixed a bug where reverb output differed between PCx64 environment and PCx86 environment.

(2) Specification changes
  (a) Changed the specification so that an error callback is returned when executing the following function,
      if the coordinate value of the vector contains a nonnumeric (NaN):
      - criAtomEx3dSource_SetPosition
      - criAtomEx3dListener_SetPosition
  (b) The following function has been deprecated:
       - criAtomEx3dListener_SetDistanceFactor
      Please consider using the following function instead:
       - criAtomEx3dListener_SetDopplerMultiplier
  (c) Changed the specification so that sound output by WASAPI is performed,
      when library is initialized using criAtomEx_Initialize_PC function.
      In previous versions, XAudio2 was used.
  (d) The function related to XAudio2 audio output has been deleted.
      Following this specification change, the following API can not be used:

      - criAtom_SetSoundBufferSize_XAUDIO2
      - criAtom_SetXAudio2Object_XAUDIO2

      Note:
      As this specification changes, applications using the criAtomEx_Initialize_XAUDIO2 function
      need to correct the following code:
      (1) Include cri_atom_wasapi.h instead of cri_atom_xaudio2.h
      (2) Use criAtomEx_Initialize_WASAPI function instead of criAtomEx_Initialize_XAUDIO2.
      (3) Use criAtomEx_Finalize_WASAPI function instead of criAtomEx_Finalize_XAUDIO2.
      (4) Modify the code so that it does not call the deleted API.

(3) New features
  (a) Added a function to use different decryption keys for each ACB handle:
      - criAtomExAcb_Decrypt
      After loading the ACB file with the criAtomExAcb_LoadAcbFile function etc.,
      it is possible to specify a different decryption key for each ACB handle
      using criAtomExAcb_Decrypt function.
  (b) Added an API that switches whether or not to apply the calculation results of
      distance AISAC and angle AISAC when playing Pan3D type applied as pan type
      by a player capable of 3D positioning calculation using CriAtomEx3dSourceHn or CriAtomEx3dListenerHn.

      Note:
      This function was added for compatibility with CRI Atom Ver.2.17.19 or earlier.
      Behavioral differences by version are as follows:
       - Ver.2.17.19 or earlier
      Regardless of pan type, the calculation result of distance AISAC, angle AISAC was applied.
       - Ver.2.17.20 or later
      The calculation result of distance AISAC and angle AISAC is applied only
      when pan type is 3D positioning.
  (c) Added a function to register the playback event callback.
      - criAtomExPlayer_SetPlaybackEventCallback
      By registering the playback event callback, it becomes possible for applications to
      grasp the timing of securing / releasing playback resources, assigning voices, and virtualization.
  (d) Added a function to acquire setting of drive parameter of REACT.
        - criAtomExCategory_SetReactParameter
        - criAtomExCategory_GetReactParameter
  (e) Added the following actions:
       - Pause action with fade time
       - Resume action with fade time

      by the criAtomExPlayer_SetAsrRackId function etc. is not applied when the following conditions are met.
      - Use cue link
      - The output destination ASR rack ID is specified in the parameter link palette of the cue link source
  (b) Fixed a bug where an exception might occur in the parameter application process.
  (c) Fixed a bug where the playback time obtained by the criAtomExPlayer_GetTime function
      does not start from the seek time, but advances from 0, when playing back seek.
  (d) Fixed a bug where setting the "max_aisacs" of the CriAtomPlayerConfig to an odd number may cause an exception.
  (e) Fixed a bug where caused an access violation when discarding an ASR rack during audio playback.
  (f) Fixed a bug where the gain application process was not applied correctly
      when the compressor or limiter's attack time or release time was set to 0.
  (g) Fixed a bug where the CriAtomExPlayer did not transition to PLAYEND
      when playback was performed using the insertion DSP pitch shifter.

 [2018-10-30 CRI Atom Ver.2.17.21]------------------------------------------
(1) Bug fixes
  (a) Fixed a bug where the error "E2011080599" would occur when releasing the ACB handle
      and the process would terminate.
  (b) Fixed a bug where a Cue with PanType set to Auto would forcibly become Pan3d at runtime.
  (c) Fixed a bug where seeking was performed for one frame at the maximum rate even
      when the Block's transition division was not enabled.
  (d) Fixed a bug where the AtomExPlayer status might not transition to PLAYEND
      when playing back audio at a rate lower than the ASR output sampling rate.
  (e) Fixed a bug where the output gain would fade-in from the level before silent input
      when a signal is applied again (using the compressor or limiter effect of the DSP Bus).
  (f) Fixed a bug where the number of samples obtained by the functions listed below would rewind
      when the following conditions were satisfied:
      Conditions:
        - Sequence end marker or Block is set in the Cue.
        - The seek time is set by the criAtomExPlayer_SetStartTime function.
        - Sequence end or Block transition occurs.
      Corresponding functions:
        - criAtomExPlayback_GetNumPlayedSamples()
        - criAtomPlayer_GetNumPlayedSample()

 [2018-09-26 CRI Atom Ver.2.17.20]------------------------------------------

      - criAtomExPlayback_GetParameterFloat32
      - criAtomExPlayback_GetParameterUint32
      - criAtomExPlayback_GetParameterSint32
      - criAtomExPlayback_GetAisacById
      - criAtomExPlayback_GetAisacByName
  (c) Fixed a bug where inconsistencies in work size calculation may have occured
      when AISAC count was set to a value other than 8.
  (d) Fixed a bug where an infinite loop occurred in server process,
      when the in-game preview was performed without attaching AWB to ACB using stream AWB.
  (e) Fixed a bug where distance attenuation AISAC could not be applied by voice playback using Cue link.
  (f) Fixed a bug where the padding area was used as a work area,
      when initializing the Cue limit work area category in the ACF data.
  (g) Fixed a bug where pre-delay and attack were started at the same time
      when pre-delay and envelope attack were used at the same time.
      The correct behavior is that the attack starts after the pre-delay is completed.

      specifying the ID of an AISAC control included in the ACF data when calling
      the criAtomExAcf_GetAisacControlNameById function.
  (f) Fixed a bug where the interpretation of the parameters of the surrounder was not 
      performed correctly for an ACF created with the following versions of CRI AtomCraft:
       - AtomCraft Ver.2.32.00 - Ver.2.35.00
       - AtomCraft Ver.3.34.00 - Ver.3.35.01
  (g) Fixed a bug where errors E2017020301 and E2017041802 occurred
      when calculating an AdmPlayer's work size.
  (h) Fixed a bug where the bus output was silent when using a pitch shifter effect
      on a bus, if the pitch was set to a value larger than half of the sampling rate.
  (i) Fixed a bug where a triggered REACT object would not return when:
      - Attaching a fader to a player
      - and the "Including cue during pause" REACT setting was set to off
  (j) Fixed a bug where a triggered REACT object would not return when:
      - Executing the criAtomExPlayer_Prepare function or Pause function and
        the player or playback object was in preparation state (PREP)
      - and the Pause release and Stop functions were executed within the same frame

  (n) Fixed a problem where the time acquired via the audio synchronization timer
      greatly shifted from the actual timing of the audio when the output was blocked for a long time
      due to plugging in / out earphones during playback.
  (o) Fixed a bug where if switch type cue is set to playlist mode and playback is performed,
      switch processing is not performed at the second and subsequent list playback, resulting in silence.
  (p) Fixed a bug where the output destination ASR rack ID specified
      in the data was not applied when the criAtomExPlayer_ResetParameters function

      Originally, it was assumed that the cue playback was performed only for
      the ASR rack ID specified by the criAtomExPlayer_SetAsrRackId function.
  (r) Fixed a problem where the APIs specifying a bus name triggered an error callback
      and processing was not completed under the following conditions:

      ACF data after the criAtomEx_RegisterAcfConfig function execution.
      Remarks:
      The criAtomEx_RegisterAcfConfig function will be abolished at SDK Ver.2.18.00.
  (f) Fixed a bug where the game variable information is initialized
      when ACF data update processing accompanying editing of ACF data information on
      the authoring tool is performed during in-game preview.
  (g) Fixed a bug where ACB data created using the following tools
      when using the monitor library becomes silent playback.
      - CriAtomEncoder.exe
      - criatomencd.exe

(2) Specification changes
  (a) When executing the following function, the behavior was changed so that
      dynamic memory allocation by the new operator does not occur in the library.
      - criAtomEx_CalculateWorkSize_WASAPI
      - criAtomEx_Initialize_WASAPI

 [2018-01-31 CRI Atom Ver.2.16.20]------------------------------------------
(1) Bug fixes
  (a) Fixed a bug where the playback rate set 
      for a block sequence was cleared at when the block was looping.
  (b) Fixed a bug where the first track was always played first
      when playing a Cue of type Random No Repeat after loading the ACB data.
  (c) Fixed a bug where the management of the bus names in the MasterOut bus failed
      when the following conditions occurred:
      - The ACF is registered by passing it in the work area.
      - The DSP bus setting not attached.
  (d) Fixed a bug where CRI Atom Craft did not update the ACF data during
      the start-up of a second (and subsequent) in-game preview.
  (e) Fixed a bug where sounds to be played on a rack ID other than
      "0" were played without going through the intended bus when the following conditions were met:
      - Multiple ASR racks are used, and the DSP bus setting is applied to each.
      - The order of the bus names of the DSP bus settings set for each rack is different.
      - The API is used to reference a rack ID different from "0".
      - Playback on another rack ID than "0" is done on multiple buses
        instead of using a direct output to the MasterOut bus.

(2) Specification changes
  (a) Changed the specifications so that it is not required anymore to release of all the ACB handles
      to release the ACF data, allowing for it to be released at any time.
      Consequently, the following points have been changed:
      - Allocation of  the work area for a category or a REACT is now done at the time
        of the ACF registration not at initialization,
        when initializing the library using a user allocator.
        If the library is initialized with its own work area,
        the ACF registration will be performed using the area specified like before.
      - When the ACF registration functions (criAtomEx_RegisterAcfConfig, criAtomEx_RegisterAcfData,
        criAtomEx_RegisterAcfFile, criAtomEx_RegisterAcfFileById) are executed,
        all sounds being played are stopped.
      - When the ACF unregistration function (criAtomEx_UnregisterAcf) is executed,
        all the sounds being played are stopped and the parameters set for the players are partially reset.
        Please reset the playback parameters as necessary.
      - If an ACF having more than the maximum number of buses allowed is 
        specified at the time of the ASR initialization
        while securing a fixed work area and initializing the library, the registration will fail.
        (Up to now, the registration succeeded but the application of the bus settings failed.)
      - In order to read the ACF file when using the criAtomEx_CalculateWorkSizeForRegisterAcfFile function,
        registration of the user allocator has become mandatory.
  (b) With the addition of a new function to the communication interface between the tool and the library,
      backward compatibility regarding the connection has been lost.
      To use the in-game preview and profiler using the CRI Atom Craft version of this SDK,
      you need CRI Atom Library Ver.2.16.18 or higher.
  (c) When a "pitch upper limit violation" warning occurs,
      the behavior has been changed to send the address of the CriAtomPlayerHn
      on which an issue occurred in the last argument of the callback.
      - W2010110801
      - W2015113001
  (d) Changed the specification so that the sound being played will not stop
      when the criAtomExSoundObject_AddPlayer function is executed with the following condition being satisfied:
      - The specified sound object and AtomEx player are already associated.

(3) New features
  (a) Added a function to acquire which track from a Cue is being played.
      - criAtomExPlayback_GetPlaybackTrackInfo
  (b) Added the ability to enumerate audio endpoints.
      - criAtom_EnumAudioEndpoints_WASAPI
  (c) Sound devices can now be explicitly assigned to the devices from CRIATOM_SOUND_RENDERER_HW1 to CRIATOM_SOUND_RENDERER_HW4
       by ID specification.
      - criAtom_SetDeviceId_WASAPI
      Please obtain the ID of the sound device by calling IMMDevice::GetId.

      - ASR Rack ID
      - Voice pool identifier
      - HCA-MX decode target mixer ID
