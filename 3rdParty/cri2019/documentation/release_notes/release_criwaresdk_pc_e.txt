[Note]
Please note the following when using CRI Atom tools:
  - Starting from the Network
    The CRI Atom tools cannot be started from the network. 
    To run the program, copy the executable files onto your PC before use. 

5.  Notes
5.1  Known problems
5.1.1  Library
The library has the following known problems:

  - An audio file may not be released immediately after the playback  
    is stopped by the criAtomExPlayer_Stop function or the player 
    handle is destroyed by the criAtomExPlayer_Destroy function.
   (There is a possibility that the audio file is still referenced within the library 
    after the player is stopped.)
  * A work around consists in destroying the player pool before releasing the data.
  - Immediately after stopping the playback by calling the criAtomExPlayer_Stop function 
    or destroying the player handle by calling the criAtomExPlayer_Destroy function 
    during the playback of a single file, a sound file that is being played may not be deleted.
   (The file may be referenced even after stopping the player.)
    Please note that the above problem occurs only when playing a sound file 
    by using the criAtomExPlayer_SetFile function.  
    The ACB file can be deleted correctly after the execution of the criAtomExAcb_Release function.
  - When ACB data is used, the seek information set by 
    the criAtomExPlayer_SetStartTime function is not cleared by 
    the criAtomExPlayer_ResetParameters function.
  * If you want to reset the seek information independently of the audio data, 
    please execute criAtomExPlayer_SetStartTime (player, 0);
  - Values that an AtomEx player has at the first server processing after 
    the execution of the criAtomExPlayer_Start function are used for 
    the following parameters to perform a playback.
      (a) ASR rack ID (criAtomExPlayer_SetAsrRackId)
      (b) Mixer ID of the HCA decoding destination (criAtomExPlayer_SetHcaMxMixerId)
      (c) Voice pool ID (criAtomExPlayer_SetVoicePoolIdentifier)
      (d) Sound renderer type (criAtomExPlayer_SetSoundRendererType)
    Therefore, when executing one of these functions immediately after 
    the execution of the criAtomExPlayer_Start function, 
    a sound played by the criAtomExPlayer_Start function may be output 
    with the parameters specified at the start of the playback.
   (Parameters may be overwritten between the execution of 
    the criAtomExPlayer_Start function and the starting of the server processing.)
    To handle these parameters each time you start the playback, 
    please prepare a dedicated AtomEx player for each of them to avoid this problem.
  - Executing the criAtomExAcb_AttachAwbFile function on the ACB data 
    loaded with the criAtomExAcb_LoadAcbData function 
   (or the criAtomExAcb_LoadAcbDataById function) may cause an access violation. 
    In order to avoid this issue, it is necessary to load the ACB data 
    into a memory area aligned on a 8-byte boundary.
  - Seeking is not supported for looping data encoded with the ADX2 codec. A noisy output may occur.

5.1.2  Tools
Please see the tool's release notes about non-implemented features.

5.2  Limitations
5.2.1  Library
The library has the following limitations:

  (a) If the file path contains a comma: ",", tab: "\\t", or line break: "\\n" character, 
      the library will interpret them wrongly as path separators and attempt to open a file with an incorrect path.
      Do not use these characters, as errors such as failing to secure memory will occur.
  (b) If you want to apply a ASR DSP effect to the L, R, Ls, Rs channels of a 4-channel waveform, 
      please set the number of ASR output channels to 6 (5.1 ch) or 8 (7.1 ch).

5.3 About CRI Atom tools Ver.3 transition
There are some unsupported items compared with CRI Atom Craft Ver.2.
For details, refer to "Released the new version CRI AtomCraft Ver.3" in the manual.
